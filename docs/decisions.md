# Decisions Log

Architectural and implementation decisions for the Westerville Lions Club website. Newest first. Each decision is numbered; the number does not change once assigned.

## Format

Each decision uses this shape:

```markdown
## DECISION-NNN: [One-line title]

**Status:** Resolved | Superseded by DECISION-MMM | Under review
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Decision:** [What we decided.]

**Rationale:** [Why we decided it — the tradeoff named out loud.]

**Impact:** [What changes in the codebase as a result; any follow-ups.]

---
```

- **Architectural decisions** (new top-level directories, new npm dependencies, structural changes) are owned by the architect agent.
- **Implementation decisions** (data shape, API surface, where logic lives, library choice within already-approved deps) are owned by the tech-lead agent.

Both kinds live in this single file, newest first. Numbers are assigned in order and never reused.
