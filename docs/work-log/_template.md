# Phase 1 — Functional Refinement (analyst)

## VERDICT

[READY FOR DESIGN | READY WITH NOTES | NEEDS REWORK | NOT YET]

## ONE-LINE TAKE

> [The feature in one honest sentence.]

## User Verbs

| Surface | Verb | Cadence |
|---------|------|---------|
| [anonymous public visitor / signed-in member / admin] | [verb] | [on demand / per session / one-time] |

## Flows

**Flow 1 — [name]:** [entry → step → step → outcome]
- Failure: [what the user sees if a step goes wrong]

**Flow 2 — [name]:** [...]

## Permissions

- **Permission(s):** [new `FEATURES.KEY`, or existing key reused]
- **Default roles:** [list]

## Gaps the Request Didn't Address

- [Gap, why it matters, suggested resolution]

## Out of Scope (confirm with user)

- [Thing the request implies but isn't in scope]

## Open Questions

- [Question for the user]

---

# Phase 2 — Architectural Review (architect)

## Verdict

[Approved | Approved with suggestions | Needs revision]

## Placement

- Directory placement: [src/...]
- Server vs Client split: [where 'use client' is needed and why]
- Dependencies: [new dep needed (yes/no), evaluation against criteria]

## Invariants Touched

- [Invariant, how this change respects it (or how it changes it — requires CLAUDE.md update)]

## Notes

[Anything Phase 3 must honor.]

---

# Phase 3 — Technical Design (tech-lead)

## Summary

[One paragraph: what we're building and why.]

## Permissions

- Permission key(s): `area.action`
- Default role bindings: [list]

## API Contract

- `POST /api/...` — purpose, request body, response shape
- `GET /api/...` — purpose, query params, response shape
- Or server-action signatures: `async function actionName(input): Promise<Result>`

## Data Model

[New tables / columns / indexes, or "No schema changes required."]

## Component / Page Plan

- Pages to create: [list]
- Components to create: [list]
- Files to modify: [list]

## Implementation Order

1. Schema (if any) → add migration in `drizzle/migrations/` and update `src/lib/db/schema.ts`
2. `FEATURES` entry in `src/lib/permissions.ts` + role binding migration
3. Route handlers / server actions
4. UI
5. Email notification (if applicable) — enqueue via `sendEmail` in `src/lib/email.ts`
6. Release notes entry

## Edge Cases & Risks

- [Thing that could fail or that needs special handling]

## Implementer

[database-admin | api-developer | ux-developer | full-stack-developer]

---

# Phase 4 — Implementation

## Files Created

- `path/to/file` — purpose

## Files Modified

- `path/to/file` — what changed

## Schema Changes

- [Tables / columns added, or "none"]
- Migration file: `drizzle/migrations/NNNN_*.sql` (idempotent)

## Implementer Notes

[Tradeoffs taken, anything that diverged from the design and why.]

---

# Phase 5 — Verification (qa)

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Verified by:** qa

## Type Check

`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`: PASS / FAIL

## Production Build

`pnpm build:only`: PASS / FAIL

## Dev-Server Smoke Test

`pnpm dev` against `.env.local` reaches the routes without runtime error: PASS / FAIL
Notes: [...]

## Manual Click-Through

| Flow | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| [user flow] | [pass / fail] | [observation] |

## Regression Notes Added (bug fixes)

- [work-log entry name — guards against: brief description]

## Verdict

[PASS | FAIL]

---

# Phase 6 — Shipped vs Intent (analyst)

## VERDICT

[SHIP IT | SHIP WITH NOTES | NEEDS REWORK]

## ONE-LINE TAKE

> [The shipped feature in one honest sentence.]

## What's Working

- [Specific. The flow that works well and why.]

## Intent-vs-Shipped Diff

- Phase 1 said: [X]. Shipped: [Y]. Verdict: [matches | acceptable drift | regression]

## Edge Cases

- Empty state: [pass | fail | not applicable]
- Failure microcopy: [pass | fail]
- Permission gate: [pass | fail]
- Mobile (360px): [pass | fail]

## Follow-Ups (if SHIP WITH NOTES)

- [Concrete, actionable. Each gets its own work-log entry.]

## Red Flags (if NEEDS REWORK)

- [Specific. What has to change before this ships.]
